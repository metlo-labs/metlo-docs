### Installation

Metlo for Nginx has two components, the Metlo nginx module and a shared libraru component. To install both of these, run:

```bash Bash
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/metlo-labs/metlo-deploy/main/connectors/nginx/install_metlo.sh >> install_metlo.sh
chmod +x install_metlo.sh
./install_metlo.sh [ --ubuntu | --debian ]
```

The rest of the installation will be handled by the script.

### Setup

Metlo requires two components to be setup within the nginx configuration file

```
# In the main configuration block
...
load_module                     modules/ngx_metlo_module.so;
thread_pool                     metlo threads=2 max_queue=65536;
...
```

In addition to this, a few environment variables have to be provided to nginx.

- METLO_URL: Your Metlo URL.
- METLO_API_KEY: Your Metlo API key
- LD_LIBRARY_PATH: /opt/metlo:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH
