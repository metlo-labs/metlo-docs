Metlo collects aggregated usage data from self-hosted instances. We do this to
analyze feature usage, plan our roadmap and handle billing. All the data we
collect is anonymized and aggregated. Optionally, If you choose to give us your
email to receive updates about Metlo it is also included.

### What data does Metlo collect?

Here is an example of usage data that gets sent to our servers:

```json JSON
{
  "instanceUUID": "44aa04d0-fef6-45c0-b742-d0ba1b455c32",
  "email": "",
  "skippedEmail": true,
  "eventName": "instanceAggregatedStats",
  "data": {
    "numEndpoints": 127,
    "numHosts": 3,
    "openAlerts": 28,
    "openHighRiskAlerts": 5,
    "piiDataFields": 32
  }
}
```

<Note>
  _For the enterprise self-hosted version of Metlo your `LICENSEKEY` is also
  included in the payload_
</Note>

### Can I disable all usage data collection?

To disable all usage data collection and have an air gapped instance you can set
the environment variable `DISABLE_LOGGING_STATS=true` when starting Metlo.
