The Alerts page shows a list of the most recent events for your security team to
look over. These alerts can be things like:

- A new endpoint was identified
- New PII Data was detected
- A new vulnerability was found
- A new API Attack was detected
- A trace which didn't match your Open API Spec was detected
- etc... ![3808](/images/f70292d-Screenshot_2022-11-26_at_7.48.15_PM.png)

You can choose to resolve each alert with a message or simply ignore it in the
UI.
