title: "SQL Injection"
---

One of the big vulnerabilities that are present on the Juice Shop app are SQL
Injection attacks. To test for and catch these `SQL Injection` vulnerabilities,
you can use Metlo's powerful Testing feature.

### 1. Setup

You can use Metlo's CLI to push predefined templates for Juice Shop
`SQL Injection`, `BOLA`, and `Broken Authentication` vulnerabilities.

```bash Bash
metlo juice-shop init-templates
```

Once the templates have been pushed to Metlo, you can view them in the
[Testing page](https://app.metlo.com/tests?page=1&tab=templates). There are two
types of SQL Injection templates: `JUICE_SHOP_SQLI` which checks if an endpoint
returns a non error status code for requests with SQL Injection payloads and
`JUICE_SHOP_SQLI_TIME_BASED` which sends Time-based SQL Injection payloads and
checks if the database is forced to wait for a longer time interval.

### 2. Create Test

Next, you can create a test from your new `JUICE_SHOP_SQLI` template. Go to the
[Endpoints page](https://app.metlo.com/endpoints) in the Metlo Web App and
search for this endpoint `/rest/user/login`. Go to the Endpoint Overview page
for that endpoint and click on the `Tests` tab. Now, click `Generate Test` and
`JUICE_SHOP_SQLI` on the drop-down menu. You should now see the test yaml which
was generated from the template you pushed earlier. If you want to read in more
depth about how the Testing feature works, you can check out our docs on
[writing a test](/testing/writing-a-test).

### 3. Run Test

Now, you can hit the `Run` button to see if the tests pass. One of the request
assertions failed because the request successfully logged in as an admin user
using a SQL injection payload for the email field.

You can also create a test for Time-based SQL Injection attacks. Follow the same
directions as in Steps 2 and 3 but when clicking `Generate Test`, select the
`JUICE_SHOP_SQLI_TIME_BASED` option from the drop-down menu instead.
