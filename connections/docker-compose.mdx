If you're app is deployed using docker compose you can add Metlo as a service to
capture API traffic data as shown below:

```yaml YAML
version: "3.9"

services:
  <your-service>:
    ...
  metlo:
    image: metlo/agent
    network_mode: "service:<your-service>"
    depends_on:
      - <your-service>
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    environment:
      - METLO_HOST=http://<YOUR_METLO_HOST>:8081
      - METLO_KEY=<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>
```

Be sure to set the `network_mode` to `"service:<your-service>"` so Metlo can
reuse your service's network stack and listen to API traffic.

By default Metlo automatically detects the interface to listen to but you can
specify the `INTERFACE` environment variable if you want to change it.
