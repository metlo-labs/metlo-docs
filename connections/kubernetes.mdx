To listen to traffic in Kubernetes, you can either set up Metlo as either a
daemonset or a sidecar.

Be sure to replace `<METLO_HOST_URL>` and `<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>` in the
templates.

By default Metlo automatically detects the interface to listen to but you can
specify the `INTERFACE` environment variable if you want to change it.

### Daemonset

Here is an example
[metlo-daemonset.yaml](https://github.com/metlo-labs/metlo/blob/develop/ingestors/kubernetes/metlo-daemonset.yaml)
file that contains just the daemonset for deploying metlo.

### Sidecar

[metlo-sidecar.yaml](https://github.com/metlo-labs/metlo/blob/develop/ingestors/kubernetes/metlo-sidecar.yaml)
contains an example for how to setup Metlo as a sidecar container.
