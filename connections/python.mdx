### Installation

Currently Metlo's Python Agent supports 4 servers:

- Django
- Flask
- FastAPI/Starlette

It can be installed from `pypi` by running :

```bash Shell
pip install metlo
```

### Configuration

#### Django

Once installed, Metlo's middleware can be added by modifying middlewares list
(in the projects `settings.py`) like so:

```py Python
MIDDLEWARE = [
    ...,
    "metlo.django.MetloDjango",
]
```

and configuring a `METLO_CONFIG` attribute in the projects `settings.py` like
this :

```py Python
METLO_CONFIG = {
    "API_KEY": "<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>",
    "METLO_HOST": "http://<YOUR_METLO_HOST>:8081"
}
```

Optional Parameters:
 - COLLECTOR_PORT: Collector port used to capture traces. Defaults to 8081
 - BACKEND_PORT: Backend port used by Metlo.
 - LOG_LEVEL: The log level Metlo should log at. The debug levels and above correspond to values used by the python logging module. A special `trace` level is also present, that provides verbose logging info. Can be
   - trace (5)
   - debug (10)
   - info  (20) - Default
   - warn  (30)
   - error (40)
 - ENCRYPTION_KEY: Key used to encrypt sensitive data, such as User session keys
 - GET_USER: A function that takes in the ASGI scope parameter and returns the user for that request. By default, Metlo collects no information about user of a request.
 - REJECT_RESPONSE: Function that produces a reponse when Metlo is set to block malicious requests. Expected to return an object of the starlette Response type.
 - MAX_BODY: Max size of request/response bodies that Metlo should capture. Defaults to 5 KB
 - DISABLED: Used to disable request blocking by Metlo.

#### Disabling during testing

METLO_CONFIG takes an optional key-value pair for disabling metlo during testing
or development. It can be added as ("DISABLED": boolean). It defaults to `False`
so that metlo captures your traces by default.

```py Python
METLO_CONFIG = {
    "API_KEY": "<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>",
    "METLO_HOST": "http://<YOUR_METLO_HOST>:8081",
    "DISABLED": <Boolean, default False>
}
```

#### Flask

Once installed, Metlo middleware can be added simply like :

```py Python
from flask import Flask

from metlo.flask import MetloFlask

app = Flask(__name__)
MetloFlask(app, "http://<YOUR_METLO_HOST>:8081", "<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>")
```

The Flask Middleware takes the flask app, Metlo collector url, and the Metlo API
Key as parameters. 

Metlo for Flask can be configured further with the following parameters:

 - BACKEND_PORT: Backend port used by Metlo.
 - COLLECTOR_PORT: Collector port used to capture traces. Defaults to 8081
 - LOG_LEVEL: The log level Metlo should log at. The debug levels and above correspond to values used by the python logging module. A special `trace` level is also present, that provides verbose logging info. Can be
 -     trace (5)
 -     debug (10)
 -     info (20) - Default
 -     warn (30)
 -     error (40)
 - ENCRYPTION_KEY: Key used to encrypt sensitive data, such as User session keys
 - GET_USER: A function that takes in the ASGI scope parameter and returns the user for that request. By default, Metlo collects no information about user of a request.
 - REJECT_RESPONSE: Function that produces a reponse when Metlo is set to block malicious requests. Expected to return an object of the starlette Response type.
 - MAX_BODY: Max size of request/response bodies that Metlo should capture. Defaults to 5 KB
 - disabled: Used to disable request blocking by Metlo.


#### Disabling during testing

Metlo can take an optional named parameter (as "disabled":boolean) for disabling
metlo during testing.

```py Python
MetloFlask(app, "http://<YOUR_METLO_HOST>", "<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>", disabled=<Boolean, default False>)
```

#### FastAPI/Starlette

Once installed, Metlo middleware can be added simply like :

```py Python
from fastapi import FastAPI

from metlo.fastapi import ASGIMiddleware

app = FastAPI()

app.add_middleware(
    ASGIMiddleware,
    "http://<YOUR_METLO_HOST>",
    "<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>",
)

...
```

The FastAPI/Starlette Middleware takes the Metlo collector url, and the Metlo API
Key as parameters. Optional parameters can then be further configured as:

- backend_port: Backend port used by Metlo.
- collector_port: Collector port used to capture traces. Defaults to 8081
- log_level: The log level Metlo should log at. The debug levels and above correspond to values used by the python logging module. A special `trace` level is also present, that provides verbose logging info. Can be
  - trace (5)
  - debug (10)
  - info  (20) - Default
  - warn  (30)
  - error (40)
- encryption_key: Key used to encrypt sensitive data, such as User session keys
- get_user A function that takes in the ASGI scope parameter and returns the user for that request. By default, Metlo collects no information about user of a request.
- reject_response: Function that produces a reponse when Metlo is set to block malicious requests. Expected to return an object of the starlette Response type.
- max_body: Max size of request/response bodies that Metlo should capture. Defaults to 5 KB
- disable: Used to disable request blocking by Metlo.

#### Disabling during testing

Metlo can take an optional named parameter (as "disabled":boolean) for disabling
metlo during testing.

```py Python
app.use_middleware(
    ASGIMiddleware,
    "http://<YOUR_METLO_HOST>",
    "<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>",
    disabled=<Boolean, default False>
)
```
