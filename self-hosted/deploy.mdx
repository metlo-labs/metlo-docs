We highly recommend using [Metlo Cloud](/getting-started) as its much easier to
get started and stay up to date! However, if you're a large company or need an
air-gapped system you can self host Metlo as well.

### 1. Sign up on our Self Hosted Portal

You can sign up for our self hosted product on
[https://my.metlo.com](https://my.metlo.com). This will automatically generate a
license key you can use for your self-hosted installation.

### 2. Deploy Metlo

You can deploy Metlo Self Hosted using one of the deployment methods in the app.
We have simple deployment methods for AWS, GCP and Azure as well as instructions
on how to deploy to Docker. It should take less than 10 minutes to deploy Metlo
in your own cloud!

### 3. Open Ports

Metlo's connectors send traffic to port 8081. Make sure to configure your
instance's firewall rules so port 8081 is open to the machines you want to
monitor.

### 4. Updating Metlo

To update to the latest version of Metlo you can ssh into your instance and run
`sudo metlo-deploy update`.

You can set up automatic updates by running `sudo crontab -e` and adding the
following to the file:

```
PATH=/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/local/bin 0 */4 * * * metlo-deploy update >> /var/log/metlo-deploy-update.log 2>&1
```

This makes sure that you always have the latest version of Metlo installed!
