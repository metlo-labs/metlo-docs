title: "Linkerd"
---

If you have mTLS setup in your Kubernetes cluster using Linkerd you can still use Metlo as either a
[daemonset](https://github.com/metlo-labs/metlo-deploy/blob/main/kubernetes/metlo-daemonset.yaml) or a
[sidecar](https://github.com/metlo-labs/metlo-deploy/blob/main/kubernetes/metlo-sidecar.yaml).

Even though the traffic is encrypted in transit, Metlo can listen to your traffic by listening to it on the
loopback interface before it hits the Linkerd proxy.

In addition to replacing `<YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>` in the templates, you also have to tell Metlo to listen
to the loopback interface and that the traffic is coming from the Linkerd proxy. This is done by
specifying two env vars:

```yaml
  - name: metlo
    image: metlo/agent
    securityContext:
      privileged: true
    env:
      - name: METLO_HOST
        value: https://app.metlo.com:8081
      - name: METLO_KEY
        value: <YOUR_METLO_API_KEY>
      - name: INTERFACE
        value: lo
      - name: ENABLE_LINKERD
        value: "true"
```
