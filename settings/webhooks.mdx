title: "Webhooks"

Using Metlo's Webhook Integration, you can add webhooks you would like us to
send data to whenever an alert is triggered. To view your integrations and add
webhooks, go to the `Settings` page and click on the `Integrations` tab. On the
`Integrations` tab, you can add, delete, and view webhooks you have previously
created.

Metlo will send a `POST` request with the alert payload to the urls you define
for your webhooks. By default, the requests will be triggered for each type of
alert that is created. The alert payload will follow this format (`Payload` is
the data that is sent, the rest of the definitions showcase what the data we
send looks like):

```json JSON
Payload {
  "alert": Alert,
  "meta": {
    "host": string,
    "totalEndpoints": number,
    "totalSensitiveEndpoints": number,
  }
}

Alert {
  "uuid": string,

#### Context

The `context` object contains any extra data related to that specific alert.

#### RiskScore

The `RiskScore` defines the score given to that alert based on its risk and is
equal to one of the following values: `high`, `medium`, `low`, `none`.

#### AlertType

The `AlertType` is a string which defines the specific type of the alert and can
be one of a certain number of values as defined above.

#### ApiEndpoint

The `apiEndpoint` field contains the endpoint info for which the alert was
triggered.

#### DataField

The `dataFields` field contains a list of the fields that belong to an endpoint.
These fields can belong to any part of an endpoint such as its request body and
headers or response body and headers.

#### DataClass

Each `DataField` has a list of sensitive data classes which are identified for
it. The `dataClasses` field contains the current sensitive data classes which
are tagged for that`DataField`. The `falsePositives` field contains any classes
that were identified by a user as a false positive. The `scannerIdentified`
field contains all the sensitive data classes that were identified by Metlo. The
list of data classes could include any Metlo defined or User defined(via Metlo
Config) Sensitive Data Classes.

#### DataSection

Each `DataField` belongs to a `DataSection` which can be in the request path
parameters, request query parameters, request headers, request body, response
headers, or response body.

#### DataType

Each `DataField` has a `dataType` field which defines the type of the values of
that `DataField`.

#### DataTag

Each `DataField` either has a value for the `dataTag` field or has null if there
is no tag for that field. For example, a `DataField` which contains sensitive
information will have a `dataTag` with value of `PII`.

#### DataPath

Each `DataField` has a value for the `dataPath` field which defines the path to
the `DataField` in the payload. For example, if the response body of an endpoint
is as defined below, then there would be two `DataField` items and each would
have a distinct `dataPath` which would be `foo.bar` and `foo.baz`:

```json JSON
{
  "foo": {
    "bar": 123,
    "baz": true
  }
}
```

If instead the response body was just a plain string, then the `dataPath` would
just be an empty string `""`.
