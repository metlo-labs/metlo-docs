## Getting Started

OWASP Juice Shop is a modern insecure web application! We've created a forked
version of the [repo](https://github.com/metlo-labs/juice-shop) that has Metlo
preinstalled. Go through this guide to get a feel of how Metlo works and find
vulnerabilities on an insecure app.

Thanks to [@bkimminich](https://github.com/bkimminich) and the rest of the Juice
Shop
[contributors](https://github.com/juice-shop/juice-shop/blob/master/HALL%5FOF%5FFAME.md)
for making a fantastic playground to test security tools!

### 1. Sign Up for Metlo Cloud ☁️

The first step is to sign up for our cloud service at
[https://app.metlo.com](https://app.metlo.com)! Once you've logged in, follow
the instructions on the Onboarding flow for the Node setup and get an API Key.

### 2. Setup Metlo Juice Shop

After you sign up for the cloud and have an API Key, setup
[Juice Shop](https://github.com/metlo-labs/juice-shop) by following the
instructions in the [README](https://github.com/metlo-labs/juice-shop#setup). We
recommend setting it up using the docker version!

To run tests from Metlo Cloud you need a public URL for our Juice Shop app. If
you're running it locally, you can use
[ngrok](https://ngrok.com/getting-started) to create a public URL.

### 3. Install Metlo's CLI

Install Metlo's CLI from npm following the instructions
[here](/installing-metlos-cli).

### 4. Initialize Data

After you have the Juice Shop server running and Metlo CLI setup, you can run
this command to populate Juice Shop with some test data. Be sure to replace
`<JUICE_SHOP_URL>` with your juice shop address.

```bash Bash
$ metlo juice-shop init-data -h <JUICE_SHOP_URL>
```

You should see all the requests getting tracked on your Metlo
[dashboard](https://app.metlo.com). It will take around 15 minutes for the
sensitive data class classifications to show up on the dashboard.

<Info>
Restarting Juice Shop

Run the init data command everytime you restart Juice Shop because the database
gets deleted on restart!

### 5. Metlo Config

To give Metlo more context for how the app works, you can provide configurations
in the `Metlo Config` tab of the `Settings` page. Paste the following into the
[Metlo Config](https://app.metlo.com/settings?tab=config) (replace the `host`
value with the host shown in the `Endpoints` page):

```yaml YAML
authentication:
  - host: <YOUR_HOST>
    authType: jwt
    headerKey: Authorization
    jwtUserPath: data.email

globalTestEnv:
  - name: USER_1_EMAIL
    value: user1@juice.shop
  - name: USER_1_PASSWORD
    value: password
  - name: USER_2_EMAIL
    value: user2@juice.shop
  - name: USER_2_PASSWORD
    value: password
```

This will allow Metlo to know how authentication is handled in the Juice Shop
app which in this case is through Json Web Tokens. The `globalTestEnv` object
will be used later in the Testing feature.
