title: "Trace Data Retention"
---

The only data that Metlo collects is api trace data to discover endpoints,
sensitive data and build model of API usage. **Trace data is cleared from the
Metlo's internal database every hour.** If you self host Metlo, **all of your
data stays in your servers**.

### Disabling Select Fields

There may be some data you never want stored in Metlo's database (like passwords
and API Keys). You can do this by specifying the fields you wouldn't like stored
in the Metlo config on the settings page in your UI.

For example, if you wanted to disable collection for the password in a `POST`
request to `/login` you would make the following rule under the `blockFields`
key:

```yaml YAML
blockFields:
  test-ecommerce.metlo.com:
    /login:
      POST:
        disable_paths:
          - req.body.password
```

The key at the top level is the host you want to select, the second is the
endpoint and the third is the method. `disable_paths` is a list of the data that
you don't want stored. In this case we don't want to store the password in the
request body. The possible sections are: `req.headers`, `req.query`, `req.body`,
`res.headers`, `res.body`.

If we wanted to disable this for all methods and not just `POST` we can specify
the `ALL` key instead of the method.

```yaml YAML
blockFields:
  test-ecommerce.metlo.com:
    /login:
      ALL:
        disable_paths:
          - req.body.password
```

You can also use `ALL` for the endpoint if you want to disable certain fields
for all endpoints as well:

```yaml YAML
blockFields:
  test-ecommerce.metlo.com:
    ALL:
      disable_paths:
        - req.headers.X-API-KEY
    /login:
      POST:
        disable_paths:
          - req.body.password
```
