title: "Custom Sensitive Data"
---

**You can customize the sensitive data classes that Metlo detects by editing the
Metlo Config on the settings tab in your UI.**

Metlo provides predefined sensitive data classes for

- Email
- Credit Card Number
- Social Security Number
- Phone Number
- IP Address
- Geographic Coordinates
- Address

To disable any of these fields from being used by Metlo you can provide a list
of classes under the `disabledDataClass` field. For example:

```yaml YAML
disabledDataClass:
  - IP_ADDRESS
  - PHONE_NUMBER
```

The allowed values are the following:  
`EMAIL`, `CREDIT_CARD`, `SSN`, `PHONE_NUMBER`, `IP_ADDRESS`, `COORDINATE`,
`VIN`, `ADDRESS`, `DOB`, `DL_NUMBER`.

You can also define your own Sensitive Data Classes for Metlo to use under the
`sensitiveData` field. For example, if we wanted to make a data class which
identifies fields which have the text `key-` or `key.` included in them, we
would make the following rule:

```yaml YAML
sensitiveData:
  <custom-data-name>:
    severity: MEDIUM
    patterns:
      - "key-"
      - "key.*"
```

The format should be an object of key, value pairs with the keys being the name
of the data class. The values should have a severity field to denote the risk
score of the class and a patterns field which should have a list of regex
patterns to use to identify that data class. The possible values for severity
are `HIGH`, `MEDIUM`, `LOW`, and `NONE`.
