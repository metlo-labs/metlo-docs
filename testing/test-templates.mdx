For common tests you probably don't want to make a YAML file manually for every
single endpoint. Metlo supports using templates to autogenerate tests.

### Builtin Templates

Metlo currently comes with 3 builtin test templates:

- BOLA
- BROKEN_AUTHENTICATION
- HSTS

You can use these types directly when running generate:

```bash Bash
$ metlo test generate -t BOLA -h <ENDPOINT_HOST> -e <ENDPOINT_PATH>

# By Endpoint UUID
$ metlo test generate -t BOLA -e 4c658611-3425-4464-9363-665842312329
```

### Using a Template in the UI

To use a template in the UI click on the dropdown on the new test button.
