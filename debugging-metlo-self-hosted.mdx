### Viewing Logs

To view logs for the self hosted version of Metlo go into the directory with
Metlo's config files and view the docker logs:

```bash Bash
cd /opt/metlo
sudo docker-compose logs
```

### Detailed Logs

To view more detailed logs add `LOG_LEVEL=TRACE` to your `.env` file and restart
Metlo by running:

```bash Bash
sudo metlo-deploy stop
sudo metlo-deploy start
```

### Not able to log in?

Since Metlo uses `secure` auth cookies by default you will only be able to log
in on `localhost` or `https` URLs. If you absolutely need to be able to log in
on `http` URLs you can add the following to `/opt/metlo/.env`:

```bash Bash
SECURE_AUTH_COOKIE=false
```
