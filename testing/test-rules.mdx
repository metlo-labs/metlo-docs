title: "Test Rules"

If you want to automatically apply an template to a set of endpoints you can define a rule on the [tests page](https://app.metlo.com/tests?tab=rules).

To define a rule you need to specify:

* **Rule Name** \- A name for your rule
* **Tests** \- A set of test templates to apply to the endpoints
* **Endpoint Filter** \- A method and regex filter that selects the endpoints you want to test
* **Host Filter** \- A regex filter that selects the hosts you want to test
* **Auto Enable** \- Whether any test created by this rule should be enabled by default or not

After you make a rule tests will be created for all endpoints that match your filters. Any new endpoint that matches will also have a test created automatically!
