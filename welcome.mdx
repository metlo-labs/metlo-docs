There’s been a 200% increase in API security breaches in just the last year with
the APIs of companies like Uber, Meta, Experian and Just Dial leaking millions
of records. **Metlo is the first Open Source API security platform that you can
self host, and get started for free right away!**

With Metlo you can:

- **Create an Inventory of all your API Endpoints and Sensitive Data.**
- **Detect common API vulnerabilities.**
- **Proactively test your APIs before they go into production.**
- **Detect API attacks in real time.**

Metlo does this by scanning your API traffic using one of our connectors and
then analyzing trace data.

## Features

![walkthrough](/images/walkthrough.gif)

- **Endpoint Discovery** - Metlo scans network traffic and creates an inventory
  of every single endpoint in your API.
- **Sensitive Data Scannning** - Each endpoint is scanned for PII data and
  given a risk score.
- **Vulnerability Discovery** - Get Alerts for issues like unauthenticated
  endpoints returning sensitive data, No HSTS headers, PII data in URL params,
  Open API Spec Diffs and more
- **API Security Testing** - Build security tests directly in Metlo with a
  simple HTTP Request editor and javascript assertions.
- **CI/CD Integration** - Integrate with your CI/CD to find issues in
  development and staging.
- **Attack Detection** - Our ML Algorithms build a model for baseline API
  behavior. Any deviation from this baseline is surfaced to your security team
  as soon as possible.
- **Attack Context** - Metlo’s UI gives you full context around any attack to
  help quickly fix the vulnerability.

## API Testing

- Metlo’s suite of automated tests and our security testing framework let you
  find vulnerabilities in development.
- Our built in testing framework helps you get to 100% Security Coverage on your
  highest risk APIs
- Integrates directly with your CI/CD
