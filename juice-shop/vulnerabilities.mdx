You can view the different types of Vulnerabilities Metlo detects from your API traffic on the [Vulnerabilities](https://app.metlo.com/vulnerabilities) page.

The Juice Shop App contains vulnerabilities like `Endpoint not secured by SSL` and `Unauthenticated Endpoint returning Sensitive Data`. Juice Shop has some endpoints such as `/rest/admin/application-configuration` which return sensitive data like Email and IP Address. Metlo gives context into which endpoints are affected by these vulnerabilities and how many there are.
