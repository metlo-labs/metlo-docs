You can also use the Testing feature on Metlo to test for and catch `Broken Object Level Authorization` (or BOLA for short) vulnerabilities.

### 1. Create Test

You can create a BOLA test from the `JUICE_SHOP_BOLA` template which logs in with 2 different users, extracts their authentication tokens, and then checks if one user can access/update any other user's data without proper authentication. Go to the [Endpoints page](https://app.metlo.com/endpoints) in the Metlo Web App and search for this endpoint `/rest/products/{param1}/reviews` for the `PUT` method. Go to the Endpoint Overview page for that endpoint and click on the `Tests` tab. Now, click `Generate Test` and `JUICE_SHOP_BOLA` on the drop-down menu. You should now see the test yaml which was generated from the templates you pushed earlier.

You can update some values in this yaml to make requests more specific to what you want to test. Replace the values of the `USER_1_param_1` and `USER_2_param_1` env variables to be `1` so that the requests are writing reviews for the product with ID of 1. Next, update the 3rd and 4th request in the yaml to have value `user1@juice.shop` for the author field and the 5th request to have value `user2@juice.shop`.

### 2. Run Test

Now, you can hit the `Run` button to see if the tests pass. As you can see, the 4th and 5th requests failed. The 4th request failed because it successfully created a review with `user2@juice.shop` as the author even though the request had `USER_2`'s JWT. Similarly, the 5th request failed because it successfully created a review with `user2@juice.shop` as the author when the request had `USER_1`'s JWT. When you are done editing the test yaml, make sure to click on the `Save` button to save your changes.

You can write similar kinds of BOLA tests for other endpoints as well using this template such as with the `Forged Feedback` and `Manipulate Basket` vulnerabilities.
