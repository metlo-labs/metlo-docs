title: "Attack Detection"
---

Metlo builds a baseline model of how your API generally behaves and is able to catch any anomalous traffic that may
be an attacker doing reconnaissance or exploiting a 0-Day vulnerability. Metlo Protection detects and blocks attacks like:

* SQL Injection
* Cross-Site Scripting
* Server-Side Request Forgery
* Remote Command Execution
* Directory Traversal
* GraphQL Introspection
* High rates of 401 errors

For any bad actors that are detected, you can easily view information such as when they were detected, their geolocation, and
a timeline of events that were flagged for that actor.

### Detections

You can also build your own detections to customize how and what Metlo flags as an attack.
