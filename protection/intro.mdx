title: "Attack Detection"
---

Our ML models build a baseline model of how your API generally behaves and is able to catch any anomalous traffic that may be an attacker doing reconnaissance or exploiting a 0-Day vulnerability. Metlo Protection detects things like:

* Broken Object Level Authorization
* Unauthenticated access
* Abnormally high usage on endpoints returning sensitive data
* Anomalous API Call Order
* High rates of 401 errors
* Cross Site Scripting
* SQL Injection

After you connect Metlo to your App, be sure to give it at least a week before our models are properly trained.
